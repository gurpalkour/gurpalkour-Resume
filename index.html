          Hi my name is Gurpal Kour, and I am currently a freshmen at the 
          University of California, Riverside. I graduated Independence High School
          in May 2019 with 3.8 GPA. In high school, I was on the volleyball and basketball
          teams. Being on a team helped me understand what it means to be on a team, and
          to efficiently work together to achieve a common goal. During both my junior and senior
          year, I organized breast cancer awareness volleyball games, and we ended up 
          raising over $1,700. I learned how to lead a group of individuals alongside with how to follow my fellow teammates.
          This experience also helped develop my communication skills. Before I was too shy to ask others for help, but
          this experience helped me understand that it is okay to ask questions when I need help. Those skills came in handy when I started working 
          at an accounting agency and at Bath and Body Works. I was able to talk to customers
          and clients easily and was able to find what they needed. At S.G. INC CPA, I was able 
          to learn how to properly answer calls and send emails. Answering the phone taught me how to 
          interact with tough clients. I became more patient and able to stay calm in 
          certain situations. At Bath and Body Works, I was easily able to talk to customers and my bosses.
          I went up to the potential customers and asked them what they were looking for, and 
          whether I can offer my assistance. That experience taught me to believe in myself
          and not back down. It is easier for me to talk to new people and introduce myself.
          I have met many new and interesting people, and made many new friends with my newfound
          confidence. Working at California's Great America, helped me realize the hard work my parents
          put in to be able to support whatever me and my little brother want to do. This was my first job,
          and my opened my eyes. I realized that I should not take anything for granted. Working in the hot
          conditions at Great America was hard, but it made me feel amazing when I got my first paycheck. 
          After that job, I work hard for everything. I work until the task is perfect and done the right way. 
          California's Great America taught me that you sometimes have to work with people you may not get along with,
          and you have to learn to manage the situation. You can not let that come in the way of your work. Towards the
          end of my time at California's Great America, I came to the conclusion that its okay if I do not get along with
          everyone. It made me realize that I can not satify everyone I encounter. After learning that life lesson, I feel
          more free to express myself, and I stopped caring in what others think of me. I have matured and bettered
          myself as I learned my lessons through my experiencses, and I will remember these lessons as I pursue my career.
